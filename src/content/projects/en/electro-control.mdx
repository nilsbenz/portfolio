I created the website for Electro-Control SÃ¼ess GMBH, a small company that offers electrical inspections. The website can be found at [electro-control.ch](https://electro-control.ch).

Since this was one of my first web projects, I didn't use a framework, but developed the website using pure HTML, Sass, and TypeScript. I used Firebase for the backend.

<Technologies used={["html", "sass", "typescript", "firebase" ]} />

The centerpiece of the website is an online calculator that allows customers to calculate the price of an electrical inspection based on various parameters and submit a request immediately. An administrator can adjust prices and options in the backend.
