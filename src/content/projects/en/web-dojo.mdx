The [Web Dojo](https://web-dojo.xyz) was my first major web project, which I developed in 2021. The goal was to create a platform for high school students to learn the basics of web development. This was because the lessons during my time at the cantonal school were not very structured.

Currently, there are various chapters on the Internet in general, HTML, and CSS. Further chapters on JavaScript and other topics are planned.

For development, I used Next.js as a Static Site Generator. Licenses are stored in Firebase and can be paid for directly by users with Stripe.

<Technologies used={["nextjs", "tailwindcss", "firebase", "stripe" ]} />

The idea was to provide students with an interactive learning environment. The chapters contain many examples and exercises that can be edited and tried out directly in the browser. A change in the editor is immediately displayed in the preview window.

The following screenshot shows an example of a course explaining the CSS properties for styling text.
