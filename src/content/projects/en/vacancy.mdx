For the Mosayebi professorship at ETH Zurich, I was responsible for evaluating and visualizing a questionnaire on the “vacancy – no vacancy” project. The website can be found at [mosayebi.arch.ethz.ch/vacancy](https://mosayebi.arch.ethz.ch/vacancy/).

In the research project, test subjects lived in the apartment equipped with rotating elements on the roof of an ETH building for one week at a time. A wall, a cupboard, and two lamps were designed to rotate. Questionnaires were completed and sensor data was collected.

The test subjects' responses were exported to a JSON file, which I then visualized using a React app. I used Chart.js for the diagrams, and the UI design is based on Material UI components.

The website offers various filter options for grouping test subjects and comparing their answers.
